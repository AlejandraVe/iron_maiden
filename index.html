                    <h2>WHY IRON MAIDEN?</h2>
                    <h3>What is Iron Maiden?</h3>
                    <p>Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and
                        primary
                        songwriter
                        Steve Harris. The line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of
                        Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian
                        Smith
                        and Janick Gers.
                        As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK
                        and US
                        Platinum and
                        Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, and 1982's The Number of the Beast -
                        its
                        first album with
                        Bruce Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was
                        a
                        turning point in
                        their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important bands. The Number of the
                        Beast is
                        among the most
                        popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.
                    </p>
                    <p>Iron Maiden have sold over 130 million copies of their albums worldwide and have
                        obtained over
                        600 certifications. The band is considered to be one of the most influential and revered rock
                        bands of
                        all time. They
                        have received multiple industry awards, including the Grammy and Brit Awards, and are also a
                        permanent
