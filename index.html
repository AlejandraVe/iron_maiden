                    <h2>WHY IRON MAIDEN?</h2>
                    <h3>What is Iron Maiden?</h3>
                    <p>Iron Maiden are an English heavy metal band formed in Leyton, East London, in 1975 by bassist and
                        primary
                        songwriter
                        Steve Harris. The line-up for most of the band's history has consisted of
                        Harris, lead vocalist Bruce Dickinson, drummer Nicko McBrain, and guitarists Dave Murray, Adrian
                        Smith
                        and Janick Gers.
                        As pioneers of the new wave of British heavy metal movement, Iron Maiden released a series of UK
                        and US
                        Platinum and
                        Gold albums, including 1980's debut album, 1981's Killers, and 1982's The Number of the Beast -
                        its
                        first album with
                        Bruce Dickinson, who in 1981 replaced Paul Di'Anno as lead singer. The addition of Dickinson was
                        a
                        turning point in
                        their career, establishing them as one of heavy metal's most important bands. The Number of the

                        popular heavy metal albums of all time, having sold almost 20 million copies worldwide.
